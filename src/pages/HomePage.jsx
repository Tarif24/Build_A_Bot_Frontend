                question="What Is A RAG Chat Bot?"
                answer="A RAG bot is a chatbot that uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. RAG combines two main components retrieval and generation. For the retrieval the bot searches a database or set of documents to find relevant information based on the user's question. while for the generation component it uses a language model (like GPT) to generate a natural language response, using both the retrieved information and its own knowledge. This approach allows the bot to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant answers, especially when the information is not part of the modelâ€™s original training data."
